Searching for a movie will search utilise themoviedb API, searching their database for similar names. Selecting a movie will take you to a single page view, displaying the movies details (poster, title). If the movie is already in our Wordpress database it will pull from that, if not it will again use themoviedb API to get the movie details - and will then add the movie to our database.

The "MOVIES" navigation menu will take you to a listing of (currently 6 max) movies, pulled from our database.
